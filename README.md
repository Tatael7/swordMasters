Market Research:

Frank Herbert's epic literary masterpiece "Dune" is in production as a 2 part movie with cast of acting juggernauts and cutting edge directors.

When we came up for the idea to make a game based on Dune, there were no games made for the series in a few years. While we were in class
there was breaking news about Legendary Entertainment obtaining the rights to produce a game.

We decided to take an approach often used by TellTale Games, which makes many Walking Dead games: make a game based on an ancillary supporting character that is not
the main character or retells the main story.
Annual video game revenue is over 40 billion a year.
